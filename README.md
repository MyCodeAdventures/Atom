I'm improving my coding step by step and that is what drives me to work on this projec - the Smart Mirror.
Yes, I'm aware it's a difficult one but I'm going to try my best! Because of this, my code is very basic and inefficient.
Hopefully as time goes on, I'll be able to come back and edit the code I have to use this as a learning experience <:
